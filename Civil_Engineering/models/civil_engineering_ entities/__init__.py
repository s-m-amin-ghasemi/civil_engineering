There are various civil engineering entities, such as bridge, tunnel.
These are the engineering sturcture.
And there are other classes of civil engineering entity.
The first class is consit of the members of various structures.
The second class is consit of raw material and intermediate products, such as poured concrete, Reinforced concrete cage
The third class is consit of properties of these entities, which are called as index
The intermeidate products are made from raw material, and members are made from intermeidate products, and 
the various structures are made of the members.
All these objects are the civil engineering entities modeled by us.
